    "# Evalutating RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore various evaluation techniques for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. In particular, we are interested in a set of metrics to evaluate RAG functionality of CMS CHAT. Rather than relying on subjective \"The answer feels right/wrong\", we want to generate a score (or rather a set of scores) to quantify our RAG's quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what is RAG quality? Let's dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define RAG. In a nutshell, RAG serves as a method to supplement LLMs with extra context to generate tailored outputs. This is done by \"adding\" context to the base LLM. \n",
    "Here is a typical RAG architecture \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/rag-system.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are several moving parts in this flow and to get good quality answer to the questions asked - we need to measure quality at each step. Is our Retriever accurate? Is our LLM generating factual answers based on the received documents? Is the answer relevant to the question asked? Most common metrics to measure these nuances are what is known \"RAG Triad\":\n",
    "- **Faithfullness** - Is the response supported by the context? Score **[0-1]**, with **1** being the most accurate\n",
    "- **Answer Relevancy** - Is the answer relevant to the query? Score **[0-1]**, with **1** being the most accurate\n",
    "- **Contextual Relevancy** - Is the retrieved content relevant to the query? Score **[0-1]**, with **1** being the most accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/RAG_Triad.png\" alt=\"alt text\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "and there are others:\n",
    "- **Contextual Precision** - Measures relevancy of the retrieved context. Score **[0-1]**. A high contextual precision score means nodes that are relevant in the retrieval contextual are ranked higher than irrelevant ones\n",
    "- **Contextual Recall** - Score **[0-1]**. It is calculated by determining the proportion of sentences in the expected output or ground truth that can be attributed to nodes in the retrieval context. A higher score represents a greater alignment between the retrieved information and the expected output, indicating that the retriever is effectively sourcing relevant and accurate content to aid the generator in producing contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there is adherence to CMS Responsible AI Principles that are defined in [CMS AI Playbook](https://ai.cms.gov/assets/CMS_AI_Playbook.pdf). Adhering to CMS’ Responsible AI (RAI) Principles ensures that the RAG model is developed and operates in alignment with CMS’ effort to navigate the risks and benefits of AI. The six principal domains of RAI include: \n",
    "- **fairness and impartiality** - Score **[0-1]**. With **1** being the most fair and impartial\n",
    "- **transparency and explainability** - Subjective. Requires Human assesment.\n",
    "- **accountability and compliance** - Subjective. Requires Human assesment\n",
    "- **safety and security** - Subjective. Requires Human assesment\n",
    "- **privacy** - Subjective. Requires Human assesment\n",
    "- **reliability and robustness** - Subjective. Requires Human assesment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with clearly defined metrics, let's dive into some calculations. We will use LLM (Anthropic's Claude 3.0 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock within CMS) as a judge and [`deepeval`](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) open source framework. "
