# Getting started with AI Workspace

This lab will walk you through the basics of connecting to the Amazon Bedrock service from Python with boto3.

First, ensure you've completed the setup in the ['Getting Started' section of the root README](../README.md#Getting-started)

Then, you'll be ready to walk through the notebook [Getting_started.ipynb](Getting_started.ipynb), which shows how to install the required packages, connect to Bedrock, and invoke models.
